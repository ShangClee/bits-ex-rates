- Used for: Smaller transactions, everyday purchases, micro-payments
- Example: `1 BITS = $0.043 USD` or `$1 USD = 23.26 BITS`

### Satoshi (STS) - The Smallest Unit
- **1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 Satoshi**
- Used for: Lightning Network, "stacking sats", very small transactions
- Example: `1 Satoshi = $0.00043 USD` or `$1 USD = 2.33K sats`
