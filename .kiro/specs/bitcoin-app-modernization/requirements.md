# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for modernizing and enhancing the existing Bitcoin Exchange Rates web application. The current application displays Bitcoin rates in BTC, BITS, and Satoshi formats across 20 currencies using a tabbed interface. The modernization will focus on improving code architecture, user experience, performance, and adding new features while maintaining the core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want a modern, modular code architecture, so that the codebase is easier to maintain, test, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is restructured THEN the JavaScript SHALL be organized into ES6 modules with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN implementing the new architecture THEN the system SHALL use modern JavaScript features (ES6+, async/await, destructuring)
3. WHEN refactoring the code THEN each module SHALL have a single responsibility (API handling, UI rendering, data formatting, etc.)
4. WHEN the new structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want improved performance and reliability, so that I can access exchange rates quickly and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
2. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide more robust error handling with user-friendly messages
3. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL implement loading states and skeleton screens for better UX
4. WHEN the user refreshes rates THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous API calls
5. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle network failures with cached data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced visual design and user experience, so that the application is more intuitive and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application THEN the system SHALL implement a modern, responsive design system
2. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL optimize the layout for touch interactions
4. WHEN displaying rates THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography and spacing throughout
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want additional functionality and customization options, so that I can personalize my experience and access more useful features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL allow users to favorite specific currencies
2. WHEN viewing rates THEN the system SHALL provide currency search and filtering capabilities
3. WHEN accessing the app THEN the system SHALL remember user preferences (selected tab, favorite currencies)
4. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the system SHALL optionally display price change indicators
5. WHEN sharing rates THEN the system SHALL provide easy sharing functionality for specific rates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and build processes, so that the application is reliable and deployable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for core functionality
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use a modern build process with bundling and optimization
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include automated testing in the deployment pipeline
4. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL maintain code quality standards with linting and formatting
5. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for API interactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want better accessibility and internationalization support, so that the application is usable by a wider audience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using assistive technologies THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
3. WHEN viewing in different languages THEN the system SHALL support basic internationalization for UI text
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful descriptions for all interactive elements
5. WHEN viewing with different color preferences THEN the system SHALL support high contrast and dark mode options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced data visualization and analysis features, so that I can better understand Bitcoin market trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing rates THEN the system SHALL optionally display simple charts or graphs
2. WHEN comparing currencies THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison views
3. WHEN tracking changes THEN the system SHALL show percentage changes over time
4. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide basic statistical information
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow users to export rate data in common formats
