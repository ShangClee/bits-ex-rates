## Running the Application

### Option 1: NPM Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# Start development server
npm run start
# or
npm run serve

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests for CI/CD
npm run test:ci
```
The start/serve commands launch a Python HTTP server on port 8080. Then visit: http://localhost:8080

### Option 2: Python HTTP Server
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then visit: http://localhost:8080

### Option 3: Any Web Server
Simply serve the files from any web server since it's a static HTML/CSS/JS application.

### Option 4: Direct File Access
Open `index.html` directly in your browser (with limited API functionality due to CORS restrictions).
